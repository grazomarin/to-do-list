# To Do List

## Built With

- React
- Sass
- Vite
- Redux / Redux Toolkit **(NEW)**

## About

This is a feature-rich interactive To-Do App. It allows users to structure their tasks, set tasks' priority ratings and add due dates and much much more. No ads, no subscriptions, no monetization.

The app structure revolves around 3 main components: Tasks, Sections, and Folders. Users can create as many folders as they want, which can hold Sections and Tasks. Each Section is a sub-folder to group your tasks, but Tasks can also exist outside of Sections
